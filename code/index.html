        <p>Not really a T-rex, huh? But a scary individual nonetheless. If you see one, you should seek shelter
          immediately.</p>

        <p>Good grass-eating dino. Good and clumsy boy, would not recommend getting close, you will most likely be

        <h3>News #4</h3>
        <p>Tree-eating dino? Really slow, like a sloth. You can climb up its tail and sit on its face, it won't even
          care.</p>
